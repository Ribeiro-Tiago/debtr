# Monthly pay tracker
A very low effort app to help me keep track of the status of my monthly expenses, given that they're paid at different points in time throughout the month

# Build (android)
If you also wanna use this, just run `npm run build` to build an android apk. No idea how to get it running on iOS as I don't have an iphone

# Todo (in no particular order)
- fix issue with total left to pay with expenses that only occur on some months (top priority)
- add linting
- add settings to choose the reset day
- update ui 
- refactor everything
- add proper icon
- add tests
- add listing of all existing expenses
- add edit expense
