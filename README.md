# Monthly pay tracker

A very low effort app to help me keep track of the status of my monthly expenses, given that they're paid at different points in time throughout the month

## Build android

- `yarn build`

## Remake icon

Icon and splash were created using https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make

- `react-native set-icon -h` to figure out how to create a new icon
- `react-native set-splash -h` to figure out how to create a new splash

# Todo

- add settings to choose the reset day
- add tests
- added i18n support
- better use of themes
